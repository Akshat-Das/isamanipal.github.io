### PID-Controllers?

Any system (also called a 'plant' in control systems jargon) tends to deviate from a set goal point practically because of many dynamic external factors.
A feedback mechanism (also known as the closed loop model) helps reduce the difference in the error with respect to the desired motion or action. It adds primary intelligence to the control system to make it reach the desired state. PID (Proportional Integral Differential) control is a feedback mechanism used in closed loop systems to improve the performance of a particular plant.
