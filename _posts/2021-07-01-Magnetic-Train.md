title:  Magnetic Levitation Train
---

Magnetic levitation train is also known as Maglev train is a 'floating' vehicle for land transportation. It uses magnetic levitation to move without touching the track. With maglev, a vehicle travels along a guideway using magnets to create both lift and propulsion, thereby reducing friction and allowing higher speeds.ðŸ’¥

This technology will prove useful for routes that are hundreds of miles long as it would be able to cover a long distance in a small amount of time.ðŸ’«ðŸ’«
